# Web Player SDK

There are two categories of docs: [Guides](https://sdk.uiza.io/docs/v4/website/tutorial-Advance%20Embed%20Code.html) and [API Docs](https://sdk.uiza.io/docs/v4/website/index.html).

Guides explain general topics and use cases \(e.g. setup\). API docs are automatically generated from the codebase and give specific details about functions, properties, and events.
