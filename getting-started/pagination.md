# Pagination

Uiza's List method is [cursor-based paginated](https://jsonapi.org/profiles/ethanresnick/cursor-pagination/). The cursors, `next_page_token` and `prev_page_token`, are strings generated by Uiza to indicate where the set of results returned to you locates in the total list. They help you to navigate through the entire set of results and extract the slice you need.

You can replace `page_token` in your request with `next_page_token` to retrieve the objects fall after the list of results you received from the previous response. Similarly, `prev_page_token` returns you the objects fall before this cursor. An empty `next_page_token` will be returned if there is no object after this cursor, and an empty `prev_page_token` means there is no object before it. Leaving `page_token` blank in your request will return you the first portion of the entire list.

#### Arguments

> **`page_size`** _number_
>
> The maximum number of objects to be returned per call, between 1 and 100. The default `page_size` is 10.

> **`page_token`** _string_
>
> The pagination cursor of the result page to be retrieved. Use the `next_page_token` returned in the previous response to retrieve the objects fall after the list of results you received. Use the `prev_page_token` to retrieve the objects fall before.
