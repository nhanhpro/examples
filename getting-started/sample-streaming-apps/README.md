# Sample Streaming Apps

Uiza provides the video and live streaming API and SDK for your app. These samples introduce various applications based on Uiza API. Refer to the following applications.

* [NodeJS Basic Live Streaming App](nodejs-live-streaming-app.md): The project is a sample application written in **NodeJS** and **React** composed of common live streaming features. 
* [Python Basic Live Streaming App](python-live-streaming-app.md): The project is a sample application written in **Python** composed of common live streaming features. 
* [Java Basic Live Streaming App](java-live-streaming-app.md): The project is a sample application written in **Java**  and **React** composed of common live streaming features. 

The web app will have two components: the broadcaster web app, to start a stream, and the viewer app, to list all broadcasts and playback the broadcast.

This is just a head start! If there’s an integration or sample application you’d like to see or if you’d like to partner with us, [ping us!](mailto:kevin@uiza.io)
